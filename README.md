# Cocrystal-prediction


This code is designed for ligand screening prediction in cocrystal formation. It is executed using Jupyter Notebook. 

To run the prediction, place the API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) and CCF (Cocrystal Former) to be predicted into the `predict.xlsx` file located within the `.\Cocrystal prediction\data\5-predict` folder.

Subsequently, execute the `.\Cocrystal prediction\5-predict.ipynb` file. 

The results will be generated and saved in the `.\Cocrystal prediction\cocrystal_predictions` folder.
